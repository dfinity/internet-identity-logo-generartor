# Internet Identity Logo Generator

An Experimental Logo Generator

The purpose of this project is to explore a generative variation of the Internet Identity logo.

The draft for this was done using and [existing experiment](https://codepen.io/meodai/pen/dyQXGKB/43ee5a1f7e17a216c22e08432aa4e240) I had done.

## Generator

This is a JavaScript-based generator that can produce various logo variations by adjusting different parameters.

## Derivation

The concept behind this generator is to incorporate the letters "i" and "D". The dot in the center represents the "point" of the "i", while the outer bar symbolizes the "D".
